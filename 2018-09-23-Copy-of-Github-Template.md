    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Well as we did in the lesson I feel that the best way to learn is to put to practice of what we have learnt and we did so and I felt that I had done it to the best of my ability and had done as much as I could during the time given.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well at first I found it difficult to put into practice what the cypher because I was trying to copy exactly what was on the board instead of what I was supposed to be doing on my computer but in the end I managed to do the shift 1 cypher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I will do for next time is I will is not copy the examples straight off the board and instead I will use the example to help me when I am doing it myself and that will help me improve my learning.</td>
